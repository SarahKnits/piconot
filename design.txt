Our language attempts to place Picobot in a map of a town. The instructions are
easy to understand due to their correspondence with real world activities. 

Each instruction specifies the street you are currently on (state), the paths
available or blocked around you (walls or empty space), the direction to go,
and the street to move to (new state). We do not intend to require all
instructions, but will treat any missing directional instruction as "*" in the 
original Picobot commands. We believe this will make the language more natural,
as one would normally say "if you can go north, go north" rather than "if you
can go north and I don't care if you can go east, go north."

This language design lends itself nicely to a visual representation. It also
translates neatly to the original Picobot command structure, while being more 
natural to write commands. 

We also considered using colors rather than streets, and believe that our 
language could be easily changed to fit with that as well.
