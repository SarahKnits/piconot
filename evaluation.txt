Hayden Blauzvern and Sarah Gilkinson
Team 7

In the course of writing our program, we found that separating our terms with
spaces resulted in fine behavior for the first two, but then broke. Because
of this, we found we needed to add periods between each pair of words. We also
found that we need to have quotes and parentheses around the street names we are
passing in. The directions were changed to be a single word by adding an
underscore where we originally had spaces, and can't was changed to cannot. 

We removed the special comments starting with # and instead just used the 
standard Scala comments.
