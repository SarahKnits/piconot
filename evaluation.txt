Hayden Blauzvern and Sarah Gilkinson

In the course of writing our program, we found that separating our terms with
spaces resulted in fine behavior for the first two, but then broke. Because
of this, we found we needed to add periods between each pair of words. We also
found that we need to have quotes around the street names we are passing in.
